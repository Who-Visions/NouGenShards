**NouGenShards turns your existing AI work into one searchable local memory.**

> **"Nou Gen"** means *"We have"* in Haitian Creole.
> NouGenAi means: **We have AI.**
> NouGenShards means: **We have memory.**
> 🇭🇹 Built by **Who Visions** to empower global diaspora intelligence.

AI tools forget because their memory is trapped inside separate apps and limited context windows. NouGenShards acts as a **Metameric Memory Engine**. It scans your machine for scattered AI traces (from Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Codex, etc.), extracts the useful context, normalizes it, and helps you reuse what worked without sending everything to the cloud.

## 🚀 Why NouGenShards?

- **AI Memory Recon**: Run `nougen brain scan` to discover and import your fragmented AI history across 15+ known tool formats.
- **Privacy First**: Your core memory stays on your machine in local SQLite databases. We redact secrets during import automatically. Centralized platforms forget or censor; local memory is immutable preservation.
- **Federated Intelligence**: Search your local shards, your production SQL databases, and remote cloud nodes simultaneously.
- **Bayesian Ranking**: The tool learns what is useful. "Marking" a shard as helpful improves future search relevance automatically.
- **Production Ready**: Built-in OpenRouter routing with automatic fallback and response healing.

## ☁️ Cloud & Hybrid Modes

NouGenShards supports three ways to use cloud intelligence:

1.  **Local (Free)**: Use Ollama or LM Studio on your own machine.
2.  **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Connect your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter keys.
3.  **Who Visions Cloud (Pro)**: Access our hosted resilient brain with metered billing and managed sync.

See [Cloud Modes](./docs/cloud-modes.md) and [Licensing](./docs/licensing.md) for details.

## 🧩 Extension Boundaries

To protect Who Visions' intellectual property, this repository contains the **Public Client**. High-value intelligence features are maintained in private modules:

- **Public Client**: CLI, local memory, BYOK adapters, AI Memory Recon, and plugin interfaces.
- **Private Brain**: Proprietary ranking formulas, agent orchestration recipes, and cost optimizers.
- **Paid API**: Hosted model gateway and global synchronization.
